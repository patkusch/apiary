## [Unreleased]

## [1.76.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Sessions UI + new tables/endpoints — Phases 1–3 + Sessions experience** (#455) — full session-as-first-class-citizen rework of the dashboard backed by four new HTTP routes and three new migrations.
  - **Phase 1 — source enum cleanup + `requestedByUserId` + 1.76.0 bump**: migration `056_drop_agent_tasks_source_check.sql` (table-rebuild) drops the `agent_tasks.source` SQL CHECK constraint in favor of Zod `AgentTaskSourceSchema` validation in `src/http/tasks.ts`. Preserves the `requestedByUserId → users(id)` FK and post-043 provider/providerMeta columns. Migration-runner regression test flipped from CHECK-throws to Zod-rejects (HTTP 400). `openapi.json` + `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/**` regenerated for the bump.
  - **Phase 2 — new tables + endpoints**: migrations `057_inbox_item_state.sql` and `058_task_templates.sql` (with v2-aware `kind`/`payload` polymorphism + 5 seed rows). New Zod schemas in `src/types.ts`: `InboxItemTypeSchema`, `InboxItemStatusSchema`, `InboxItemStateSchema`, `TaskTemplateSchema`. New DB helpers: `listInboxState`, `upsertInboxState`, `listTaskTemplates`, `getRootTaskChain` (recursive CTE), `listRecentSessions`. `getAllTasks` now accepts `string | string[]` status (CSV-friendly) + `createdAfter` ISO filter.
    Four new HTTP route files via the `route()` factory (auto-registered in OpenAPI):
    - `src/http/users.ts` → `GET / POST / PUT /api/users` (3 endpoints)
    - `src/http/sessions.ts` → `GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{rootTaskId}` (2 endpoints)
    - `src/http/inbox-state.ts` → `GET, PATCH /api/inbox-state` (2 endpoints)
    - `src/http/task-templates.ts` → `GET /api/task-templates` (kind + query + category filters)
    Existing `POST /api/tasks` is now tolerant of unknown `requestedByUserId` (coerces to `NULL` + warn instead of FK 500). `GET /api/tasks` accepts CSV `status` and `createdAfter` filters.
  - **Phase 3 — identity boot gate + `parentTaskId` / `requestedByUserId` plumbing**: composer follow-ups now route correctly via the lead by default for any task without an explicit `agentId` (drops the `!parentTaskId` guard). UI composer follow-ups are no longer left unassigned.
  - **Sessions UI**: brand-new `/sessions` route with `SessionsShell`, `SessionTimeline`, collapsible `ParallelGroup`, `TaskCard` (passive — opens `TaskDetailSheet` via Maximize2 button), `<OutcomeBlock>` with copy-to-clipboard, Markdown-rendered failure / output sections (via `<Streamdown>`), session timeline showing the actual requesting user name resolved from `useUsers` cache, "Session start" badge, and an Eye-off toggle to hide system tasks (default hidden, count surfaced in tooltip, persisted under `agent-swarm-sessions-show-system`). Session detail page at `/sessions/[rootTaskId]`.
- **`HARNESS_PROVIDER` overridable via `swarm_config` (live reconcile)** (#455) — workers now resolve their effective harness from `swarm_config` (repo > agent > global) overlaid on `process.env`, defaulting to `"claude"`. Poll loop re-fetches every ~10s and swaps the adapter live (with `basePrompt` rebuild) when the resolved value changes — operators flip a worker's provider from the dashboard without restarting. Symmetric to `MODEL_OVERRIDE` precedence. `PATCH /api/agents/{id}/harness-provider` now mirrors its value into a `swarm_config` row at `scope=agent`. New `validateConfigValue` guard rejects invalid `HARNESS_PROVIDER` values at write time (HTTP 400 + MCP error). `docker-entrypoint.sh` skips `HARNESS_PROVIDER` when baking config to env (so a deleted `swarm_config` row isn't shadowed by a stale env value). 17 new tests in `harness-provider-resolution.test.ts` + PATCH side-effect coverage; E2E in docker covers boot default → PUT swarm_config → PATCH route → DELETE fallback to env.
- **Cloud personalization & adaptive home — phases 1–4** (#452) — agent-swarm now feels like *your* deployment from the moment a user opens it.
  - **Phase 1 + 1.5 + 1.6** — `GET /status` (identity + 7 setup milestones + activity + agent_fs), `POST /status/test-connection` for live harness verification, new `HomePage` at `/` (legacy `DashboardPage` demoted to `/dashboard`), per-agent `harness_provider` column (migration 054), iteration & polish (sidebar branding, OAuth-aware credential validation, harness column on `/agents`, demo seed script, [Personalization & Status guide](docs-site/.../guides/personalization.mdx)).
  - **Phase 2** — additive `health` rollup on `/status`, `StatusContext` that dedupes fetches, `AppHeader` health badge polling every 30s with Page Visibility pause, cloud-aware Docs/Support/Billing menu items in the swarm switcher, subtle self-host marketing footer.
  - **Phase 3** — `template-recommendations.ts` maps detected integrations to starter templates (`slack+github` → `pr-triage`, `linear+github` → `issue-to-pr`, `jira` → `bug-intake`, fallback → `hello-world`). Empty states on `/templates`, `/tasks`, `/workflows` plus a "First steps" card on home. Four template stubs land under `templates/official/`.
  - **Phase 4** — `useDismissibleCard` hook namespaced by `apiUrl` (storage key `swarm:v1:${apiUrl}:${cardKey}`), welcome card on home, per-milestone collapse, and tour-completion full-section collapse once the four MVP milestones have each been verified at least once.
  - New cloud envs: `SWARM_CLOUD`, `SWARM_ORG_NAME`, `SWARM_ORG_LOGO_URL`, `SWARM_BRAND_COLOR`, `SWARM_MARKETING_URL`, `SWARM_HIDE_CLOUD_PROMO`, `SWARM_VERIFY_TTL_MS`. Worker-side `HARNESS_PROVIDER` is now reported on register and drives the harness milestone.

### Changed
- **Slack manifest scopes trimmed for App Directory submission** (#454) — drops 4 redundant bot scopes (`chat:write.public`, `mpim:read` / `mpim:history` / `mpim:write`) and the matching `message.mpim` event. Group-DM support isn't used by any handler in `src/slack/`, and reviewers prefer explicit bot invites over `chat:write.public`. Also flips `token_rotation_enabled` to `true` (marketplace requirement). Socket mode preserved — HTTP migration is a separate PR.
- **Memory rater — Stop-hook summarizer swapped to OpenRouter SDK** (#450) — the sub-`claude` CLI piggyback path silently produced "Not logged in · Please run /login" rows after the 2026-05-05 `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` bump (2.1.112 → 2.1.126) stopped propagating `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to hook subprocesses (0 LLM rater rows ever, 417 garbage session-summary rows over 2 days). Replaced with a Vercel AI SDK `generateObject` call against OpenRouter — schema-validated `{summary, ratings}` output, no manual envelope/fence parsing. Default model: `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` (Gemini 3 Flash via OpenRouter — materially cheaper than Haiku 4.5: $0.5/M input + $3/M completion vs $1/M + $5/M). Override via `MEMORY_RATER_LLM_MODEL`. **No-op when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is unset** — self-hosters / OSS users skip session summary + LLM ratings entirely rather than falling back to the broken claude path. Drops 251 LOC of dead JSON-fence parsing code (`parseSummaryWithRatings`, `extractSummaryFromClaudeStdout`, `tryParseLooseJson`).
- **Worker self-reports `cred_status`** (b89d6a06) — credentials adapter import removed from the API bundle; the worker reports its credential status directly via `PUT /api/agents/{id}/credential-status` instead of having the API duplicate provider-specific resolution logic. Reduces API bundle size and keeps provider knowledge worker-side.
- **Status: harness milestone is fleet-derived** (6561b6cb) — `GET /status` no longer reads `process.env.HARNESS_PROVIDER` on the API process (a worker-side env var). Instead it derives the milestone from the registered worker fleet — surfaces a clear "No workers registered with `HARNESS_PROVIDER=…`" hint when the live-test target has no agents.

### Fixed
- **Memory rater dedupes scheduled-task self-similar memories** (#451) — scheduled tasks fire byte-identical `task.task` text every run, and task-completion memories are named `Task: ${task.task.slice(0, 80)}`. The previous LLM rater scored 5+ near-clones at +1.0 each in one cron pass, inflating `alpha` 5x in a single session. New `dedupeRetrievalsForRater` in the Stop hook keeps the freshest occurrence per memory name. Includes regression tests (5 cron clones + 1 distinct → 2 rows).
- **Codex creds: `~/.codex/auth.json` is a valid live-test bypass** (8d06bc53) — the harness milestone live-test now treats the on-disk Codex auth file as a successful credential bypass, matching the documented Codex provider precedence (OAuth file > API key).
- **Memory rater Stop-hook regression chain** (#444, #445, #447) — the LLM piggyback rater introduced in #429 had been silent in production since deploy. Three follow-ups landed the fix:
  - **#444** — gate-trace logging in the Stop hook to expose which precondition was failing
  - **#445** — pass `taskId` via `AGENT_SWARM_TASK_ID` (and `AGENT_SWARM_AGENT_ID`) env vars instead of relying on the on-disk `TASK_FILE`. The file disappeared mid-session in production, so `Bun.file().text()` threw ENOENT; the catch swallowed it and `taskId` stayed undefined, which short-circuited `fetchRetrievalsForTask`
  - **#447** — tolerant JSON parser (`tryParseLooseJson`) for Haiku output that occasionally wrapped the inner `result` in ` ```json ` fences or prefixed it with a short prose preamble. Strict `JSON.parse` rejected those shapes; the new helper strips fences and falls back to first-`{` / last-`}` slicing. The summarizer prompt also got an explicit no-fences / no-preamble directive as defense-in-depth. Includes regression tests for both `parseSummaryWithRatings` and `extractSummaryFromClaudeStdout`

### Changed
- **`Dockerfile.worker`** — bumped `CODEX_VERSION` from 0.125.0 to 0.128.0; matching `@openai/codex-sdk` bump from `^0.125.0` to `^0.128.0` in `package.json` (#442)
- **`Dockerfile.worker`** — `@desplega.ai/qa-use` bumped to 2.17.0 to dodge a `workspace:*` resolution failure in 2.15.3 that broke uncached Docker Build CI; pinned `@huggingface/hub` to 2.11.0 via npm overrides to work around `@huggingface/xetchunk-wasm@0.0.4` shipping unpublished `workspace:*` siblings. Switched the global-tool install pattern from `npm install -g` to staging-dir install + symlink-to-`/usr/local/bin` so the override applies (#447)

## [1.75.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Memory rater v1.5 — completion (steps 4–7)**:
  - **Step 4 (#429)** — `LlmRater` (`src/be/memory/raters/llm.ts`) that piggybacks on the existing Stop-hook session-summary Haiku call. When `MEMORY_LLM_RATER_ENABLED=true` the summarizer prompt is augmented to also rate retrieved memories `useful: true | false`; ratings are POSTed to `/api/memory/rate` with `source: "llm"`. Zero extra LLM round-trips on the worker hot path
  - **Step 5 (#428)** — `memory_rate` MCP tool. Agents can record explicit usefulness ratings on a retrieved memory in their current task (`useful`, optional short `note`, optional `referencesSource` external pointer). Spam-guarded by the `memory_retrieval` row produced when the memory was surfaced; out-of-task calls are rejected. Wired through the worker `ExplicitSelfRatingRater` and surfaced in the runner-injected memory recall prompt (`src/prompts/memories.ts`)
  - **Step 6 (#436)** — `referencesSource` edges. The optional free-form `<source>:<identifier>` field on `memory_rate` (e.g. `github:owner/repo#N`, `linear:KEY-N`, `customer:<slug>`, `slack:<channel>:<ts>`) creates/updates an edge from the rated memory to the external artifact it cites. Sanitized for NUL bytes and control characters
  - **Step 7 (#440)** — v1.5 capstone: docs + business-use flow instrumentation + cross-cutting end-to-end tests covering the implicit-citation, llm, and explicit-self rater paths. `MCP.md` regenerated to surface the new `memory_rate` tool entry
- **Worker credential safe-loop** (#441) — workers no longer crash-loop when harness credentials are missing. The TypeScript-level `awaitCredentials` (`src/commands/credential-wait.ts`) replaces the bash-level fail-fast in `docker-entrypoint.sh`. The container always boots, calls `join-swarm`, and parks in a `waiting_for_credentials` agent status while polling `swarm_config` for the missing variables. Status is reported via `PUT /api/agents/{id}/credential-status`; the dispatcher's `getIdleWorkersWithCapacity` predicate already excludes non-`idle` workers, so blocked agents are routed around without any extra condition. Self-heals as soon as the credential lands — no container restart required. The single hard exit retained is `API_KEY` (without it the worker can't talk to the API at all)

### Changed
- **`new-ui` directory renamed to `ui`** (a2e86719) — README, configs, and CI workflows updated to reference the canonical `ui/` path. Standalone landing site removed (60bb0ea8) in favor of the rewritten `agent-swarm.dev` (#438)
- **`new-ui` design system migration** (#439) — tokens, primitives, and composition layer for the dashboard. Lays groundwork for shared-component reuse across the dashboard, templates UI, and docs site
- **Landing v2 — Coordination Intelligence rewrite of `agent-swarm.dev`** (#438)

### Fixed
- **Thin meta descriptions across landing & docs pages** (#433) — automated SEO pass expanded short/missing meta descriptions to improve search snippets

## [1.74.4] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Workflow `wait` executor** (#420) — pause a run for a fixed duration (`mode: "time"`, `durationMs` in 1ms..1y) or until a `workflowEventBus` event satisfies an optional payload filter (`mode: "event"`, `eventName` + `filter` + `scope: run|global` + optional `timeoutMs` routing to the `timeout` port). Time mode and event-mode timeouts wake via the `wait-poller`; event matches resume via the workflow event bus. Brings the built-in executor count to 10
- **Workflow `triggerSchema` end-to-end authoring** (#423) — workflows can attach an optional JSON Schema to validate `triggerData` across every entry path (manual `/trigger`, webhooks, schedules, `trigger-workflow` MCP). Mismatched payloads are rejected with HTTP 400 (or MCP error) **before** a run is created. New / updated MCP tools: `create-workflow`, `update-workflow`, `patch-workflow` (and `trigger-workflow`'s validator surface). HTTP `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH /api/workflows/{id}` accept `triggerSchema` (and `null` on `PUT`/`PATCH` to clear). Failure responses echo the active schema so callers can self-correct. Validator subset is deliberate: `type`, `required`, `properties`, `enum`, `const`, `items`; other keywords (`oneOf`, `anyOf`, `$ref`, `pattern`, `format`, …) are silently ignored. Frontend editor + tester in `new-ui/`
- **Linear: workflow-state gate + `swarm-ready` label override** (#395) — Linear webhooks now only trigger swarm tasks for issues whose `WorkflowState.type` is in the configured allowlist (default: `unstarted, started, completed, canceled` — i.e. everything except `triage` and `backlog`). A configurable label (default `swarm-ready`, override via `LINEAR_SWARM_READY_LABEL`) bypasses the gate so users can pre-stage backlog issues. Skipped assignments leave a comment on the AgentSession explaining how to retry
- **Memory rater foundations (steps 1–3 of v1.5)** (#425, #426, #427):
  - Step 1 (#425): `memory_rating` schema, `MemoryRater` spine, and a `NoopRater` reranker as a typed seam for future raters
  - Step 2 (#426): retrieval bridge (`memory_retrieval` rows) + `ImplicitCitationRater` so citations in agent output map back to the memories that were retrieved into the prompt
  - Step 3 (#427): `POST /api/memory/rate` (Zod-validated `RatingEvent[]`, max 50, source ∈ `llm, explicit-self`, R6 spam-guard requires a matching `memory_retrieval` row for `explicit-self`, 409 on partial-unique-index dup) and `GET /api/memory/retrievals` (joins `memory_retrieval × agent_memory`, scoped by `X-Agent-ID`, ORDER BY `retrievedAt` DESC, LIMIT 50, 500-char content snippet). OpenAPI + `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/memory.mdx` regenerated

### Changed
- **Workflows concept doc + runbook** updated for `wait` (10 executors) and `triggerSchema` (`docs-site/content/docs/(documentation)/concepts/workflows.mdx`)
- **`.mcp.json` precedence fix for multi-root workspaces** (a2963f2b) — multi-root MCP config resolution now picks the right manifest

### Fixed
- **Codex provider: prefer OAuth over API key** (`v1.74.4`, c92df43b) — Codex harness now selects the ChatGPT OAuth credential when both an OAuth token and an API key are present, matching the documented precedence
- **Trackers: ensure tokens are refreshed** (4dcdfd96) — `tracker-status` MCP tool and surrounding integration paths now refresh tracker OAuth tokens before issuing API calls instead of failing on stale tokens

## [1.74.1] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- Regenerated `openapi.json` and `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/**` to embed the bumped `package.json` version (no functional API changes)

## [1.74.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Per-task `outputSchema` support documented across harness providers** (#6faabc9d). `docs-site/content/docs/(documentation)/guides/harness-providers.mdx` and `runbooks/harness-providers.md` now carry a supported-providers table for `outputSchema` enforcement: `claude`, `claude-managed`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi` enforce the schema via the `store-progress` MCP tool; `devin` only enforces when `HAS_MCP=true`, and the runner now carries an explicit NOTE in `ensureTaskFinished` (`src/commands/runner.ts:551`) that default-mode Devin's `providerOutput` is **not** validated against `task.outputSchema` and is stored as-is. Callers should not assume `JSON.parse(task.output)` will succeed when the task ran on default-mode Devin
- **Marketplace plugin pin** — Claude marketplace plugin install in `Dockerfile.worker` now pins `desplega-ai/ai-toolbox@cc-desplega-2.0.0` (was floating)

### Changed
- **Bumped pinned harness CLIs in `Dockerfile.worker`**:
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` 2.1.112 → 2.1.126
  - `PI_CODING_AGENT_VERSION` 0.67.2 → 0.73.0
  - `CODEX_VERSION` 0.118.0 → 0.125.0
- **Bumped global npm tooling in `Dockerfile.worker`**:
  - `@desplega.ai/qa-use` 2.14.0 → 2.15.3
  - `@desplega.ai/agent-fs` 0.4.0 → 0.5.1
- **Bumped pinned dependencies in `package.json`**:
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` `latest` → `^0.93.0`
  - `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core` / `pi-ai` / `pi-coding-agent` ^0.67.2 → ^0.73.0
  - `@openai/codex-sdk` ^0.118.0 → ^0.125.0
- **`pi-mono` adapter now passes `cwd` and `agentDir` to `DefaultResourceLoader`** (`src/providers/pi-mono-adapter.ts`) — uses the new `getAgentDir()` export from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` so the resource loader resolves task-local paths correctly. Adapter switched from `@sinclair/typebox` to the bare `typebox` re-export to track the upstream pi-mono package's bundled types

## [1.73.5] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **opencode harness provider foundations** — `HARNESS_PROVIDER=opencode` is now wired into `createProviderAdapter` (#399, #400, #403, #412). Rolling out across DES-295 → DES-304:
  - **DES-295** (#399): `ProviderNameSchema` adds `"opencode"`; new `CostData.provider` discriminator (`"claude" | "codex" | "pi" | "opencode"`) so the API can route Codex's pricing-table recompute vs. trust the harness-reported `totalCostUsd`. Migration `048_agent_provider.sql` adds an `agents.provider` column for per-agent provider pinning. `openapi.json` regenerated
  - **DES-296** (#400): `fetchInstalledMcpServers` extracted from `claude-adapter.ts` into shared `src/utils/mcp-server-fetcher.ts` so non-claude adapters (opencode, future ones) can reuse the swarm-MCP install discovery
  - **DES-297** (#412): `validateOpencodeCredentials(env)` in `src/utils/credentials.ts` checks `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` in priority order and fail-fasts at boot when none are present. `PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_VARS` map now includes `opencode: ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "OPENAI_API_KEY"]` so a worker pinned to opencode doesn't stamp unrelated credentials onto its task records
  - **DES-299** (#403): `OpencodeAdapter` + `OpencodeSession` now spin up an in-process `@opencode-ai/sdk` server, subscribe to its SSE event stream, map events to the swarm's `ProviderEvent` union, accumulate per-`AssistantMessage` cost into `CostData`, and persist every event as a `raw_log` row through `scrubSecrets`. Idempotent `abort()` closes the server cleanly
  - **DES-300** (#413): Per-task agent file for opencode plus environment isolation via `OPENCODE_CONFIG` and `OPENCODE_DATA_HOME` so concurrent opencode tasks no longer share config/state (`src/providers/opencode-adapter.ts`, tests in `src/tests/opencode-adapter.test.ts`). Supersedes the auto-closed #405 after the parent `feat/des-294-des-299` branch was deleted on #403's merge — content unchanged, only the base branch was retargeted
  - **DES-301** (#406): Self-contained opencode plugin at `plugin/opencode-plugins/agent-swarm.ts` (~290 LOC) ports every swarm hook behavior — `tool.execute.before` does the cancellation poll + ScheduleWakeup polling-block check, `tool.execute.after` heartbeats `/api/agents/<id>/heartbeat`, `experimental.chat.system.transform` injects the lead concurrent-tasks context, `experimental.session.compacting` re-injects the task goal (PreCompact parity), `event:file.edited` syncs SOUL/IDENTITY/TOOLS/CLAUDE.md and auto-indexes `/memory/` writes, `event:session.idle` does the final identity sync + session summary + `/api/sessions/<id>/close`. `OpencodeAdapter` now resolves the plugin absolute path via `import.meta.dir`, attaches it via the per-task config, and sets `SWARM_API_URL` / `SWARM_API_KEY` / `SWARM_AGENT_ID` / `SWARM_TASK_ID` / `SWARM_IS_LEAD` env vars for the spawned process (restored in `finally` to prevent cross-task contamination). `@opencode-ai/plugin@1.14.30` added as devDependency for the `Plugin` type
  - **DES-302** (#407): `Dockerfile.worker` installs the opencode CLI (`ARG OPENCODE_VERSION` + curl installer) and SDK (`ARG OPENCODE_SDK_VERSION` + `npm install -g @opencode-ai/sdk`), and copies `plugin/opencode-plugins/agent-swarm.ts` into the image at `/home/worker/.config/opencode/plugins/`. `docker-entrypoint.sh` gains an `elif HARNESS_PROVIDER=opencode` branch in the credential validation block (one of `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` must be present) and in the binary-check section. `docker-compose.example.yml` ships a commented `worker-opencode` service block as a starting point
  - **DES-303** (#409): Added `## Opencode` section, provider-comparison-table column, adapter-dispatch block, and Docker config example to `docs-site/.../guides/harness-configuration.mdx`. `docs-site/.../reference/environment-variables.mdx` adds `opencode` to the `HARNESS_PROVIDER` allowed-values plus a credentials sub-table (OPENROUTER primary, ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, `auth.json` fallback). `runbooks/harness-providers.md` gains a supported-providers summary table that includes opencode
  - **DES-304** (#410): `scripts/e2e-docker-opencode.ts` — focused end-to-end Docker smoke for the opencode harness. `basic` builds the worker image, runs an `HARNESS_PROVIDER=opencode` container, posts a write-file task, asserts `unassigned → in_progress → completed`, the resulting `/workspace/hello.txt` content, and `tasks.provider = 'opencode'`. `isolation` runs two concurrent containers and verifies independent completion plus per-task `OPENCODE_DATA_HOME` isolation. CLI flags: `--test basic|isolation`, `--skip-build`, `MODEL_OVERRIDE=…`
- **[Receipts](/docs/receipts) section in docs-site with a [Ralph Loop](/docs/receipts/workflows/ralph-loop) workflow recipe** (#411). Public JSON workflow definition at `docs-site/public/receipts/workflows/ralph-loop.json` so it can be imported via the templates flow

### Changed
- README "Multi-provider" line + docs-site Harness Configuration / Harness Providers / Environment Variables / Overview pages now list `opencode` alongside the existing five providers
- SEO-tuned descriptions on top architecture pages — overview, agents, memory (#408)
- **`db-query` MCP tool no longer lead-only** (#415) — drops the `callerAgent.isLead` gate so any authenticated agent (workers included) can issue read-only queries against the swarm DB. Unblocks the 4-week-stale worker → Linear interaction path: workers can now fetch their own `oauth_tokens` row and hit Linear's GraphQL API via the `linear-interaction` skill without round-tripping through the lead. Acknowledged trade-off: workers gain full read access to `oauth_tokens`, `configs` (still encrypted at rest), and every other DB row. Long-term path is dedicated `linear-*` MCP tools so the trust boundary can shrink back to lead-only `db-query`. HTTP `/api/db-query` remains API-key gated as before. Tool description and `MCP.md` / `docs-site/.../reference/mcp-tools.mdx` synced

### Fixed
- **Docker `Build + Publish + Deploy` workflow has been red on every push to `main` since #407** (#416, DES-294). Three latent bugs in `Dockerfile.worker` shipped together because CI's only opencode-touching signal was the build itself, which hit the version-pin failure long before the runtime issues could surface:
  1. `OPENCODE_VERSION` bumped `0.5.10 → 1.14.30` to match the `@opencode-ai/sdk` pin. `opencode.ai/install` resolves versions via `anomalyco/opencode`, whose earliest tag is `v1.3.17`. The old pin's release page 301'd (so the installer kept going) but the tarball returned a 9-byte HTTP 404 body that `tar xz` rejected with `gzip: stdin: not in gzip format`
  2. `ENV PATH="/home/worker/.opencode/bin:$PATH"` set immediately after the install — the opencode installer only patches `~/.bashrc`, so non-interactive shells (the entrypoint, gosu drops, the SDK's `cross-spawn`) missed it and `docker-entrypoint.sh:166`'s `command -v opencode` would `FATAL` in production
  3. `chown -R worker:worker /home/worker` after the root-side `npm install -g` + `qa-use install-deps` block, so opencode (running as worker uid 1001) doesn't `EACCES` on its first `mkdir /home/worker/.cache/opencode`
  Plus `MODEL_OVERRIDE` is now forwarded through `scripts/e2e-docker-opencode.ts` so the Docker test can pin a model without editing the script. Four follow-up bugs uncovered during end-to-end verification (plugin path resolves to a non-existent location in the bundled binary; `agent_tasks.provider` / `.model` and `agents.provider` / `.lastActivityAt` not persisted; runner `Failed to save cost data: 400`) are documented in `thoughts/taras/qa/2026-05-03-opencode-integration-des294.md` for separate follow-up

## [1.73.4] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Worker auto-clone leaves repos owned by `root:root`, breaking subsequent runner sessions with `fatal: detected dubious ownership`.** `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs as root until the final `gosu worker` exec, so the auto-clone block was cloning repos as root and the worker user couldn't run `git` against them on later boots. The auto-clone loop now invokes `gh repo clone` / `git pull` via `gosu worker bash -c …` so `.git` ends up owned by `worker:worker`. The `2>/dev/null` mask on `git pull` (which had been hiding this exact failure on subsequent boots) is also removed (#398)
- **Defense-in-depth: `git config --system --add safe.directory '*'` early in entrypoint** so any other root-vs-worker uid mismatch on `/workspace` (Archil/FUSE mounts, host-mounted volumes, manually-created paths) no longer trips the "dubious ownership" check (#398)
- **Slack `event_id` idempotency on the task-creation path (DES-293).** Slack retries event deliveries on 3s timeout / 5xx, so a slow handler (e.g. one that fetches thread context before calling `createTaskExtended`) was producing N duplicate task rows from a single user message — root cause of the 2026-04-30 multi-session race (1 user message → 3 task rows → 3 Researcher sessions → 3 duplicate Jira pushes). New in-memory cache `src/slack/event-dedup.ts` keyed by `body.event_id` (5-min TTL, `unref`-ed cleanup timer) is checked at the top of `app.event("message")` and the assistant `userMessage` middleware. On a hit the handler logs `dropping Slack retry: event_id=…` and returns early so Bolt acks 200 OK and Slack stops retrying. Single-process design — Socket Mode means all events flow through one WebSocket; if we ever horizontally scale the API, swap in a DB- or Redis-backed cache (#396)
- **Terminal-status idempotency in `completeTask` / `failTask` / `store-progress` (DES-292).** Re-completing or re-failing a terminal task was overwriting `output`/`finishedAt`, re-emitting `task.completed` / `task.failed` on `workflowEventBus`, inserting duplicate `task_status_change` log rows, triggering `business-use ensure` with a now-failing validator, indexing duplicate memory entries, and **creating duplicate follow-up tasks to lead** — the downstream noise from the same 2026-04-30 race. `src/be/db.ts` `completeTask` / `failTask` now early-return `null` when the task is already terminal (mirrors `cancelTask`); `src/tools/store-progress.ts` short-circuits before any side-effects with `wasNoOp: true`, so the post-transaction memory-write and follow-up-task-creation blocks are gated on `!wasNoOp`. First-call-wins (#397)
- **Partial task-ID search on the new-UI tasks list page (DES-286).** `getAllTasks` and `getTasksCount` in `src/be/db.ts` now match `(task LIKE ? OR id LIKE ?)`, and the search-input placeholder reads `Search by description or ID...`. Pasting the first 6–8 characters of a task UUID surfaces it (#394)

## [1.73.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Memory dashboard at `/memory`** in the new-UI. New router page, sidebar entry, `useMemory` hook, and shared `<CollapsibleDescription>` component. Surfaces memory entries with scope, source, tags, and per-row delete; lists agents and recent indexing activity
- **Memory HTTP API** — new `src/http/memory.ts` exposing `POST /api/memory/index`, `POST /api/memory/search`, `POST /api/memory/re-embed`, `GET /api/memory`, and `DELETE /api/memory/:id`. All routes registered via the `route()` factory and surfaced in `openapi.json` + `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/memory.mdx`
- **Workflows-detail page improvements** in the new-UI — richer node/run rendering on `/workflows/:id` and surfaced workflow context on `/tasks/:id`

### Changed
- `scripts/seed.ts` + `scripts/seed.default.json` extended with memory + workflow fixtures used by the new dashboard

## [1.73.2] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Regenerated `openapi.json` and `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/**` to track route metadata (no functional changes)

## [1.73.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Slack tree connectors render misaligned in Slack's proportional sans-serif font.** Box-drawing characters (`├ └ │`) shift unpredictably across glyph widths, so progress blocks looked broken under nested children. Switched to a single `↳` indent with 3-space continuation, which renders cleanly regardless of font (#392)

## [1.73.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **API runtime image now ships `bun` + `python3`** so the script-workflow executor can run `ts` and `python` script nodes inside the API container. The compiled API binary doesn't include the `bun` CLI itself; the `bun` static binary is now copied from the `oven/bun:latest` builder stage (already cached in the build image) instead of re-fetched. `python3` installed via `apt-get --no-install-recommends` with apt lists cleaned. Image stays lean — only adds `python3` + the bun static binary. Repro that motivated the fix: workflow `script-backends-test` failed on `ts`/`python` nodes with `Executable not found in $PATH: "bun" / "python3"` (#391)
- **`DEFAULT_APP_URL` shared constant** at `src/utils/constants.ts` (`https://app.agent-swarm.dev`) — used as the dashboard fallback for Slack task links, workflow HITL approval URLs, and any other call sites that previously hard-coded a local default. `getTaskLink()` now always returns Slack mrkdwn link syntax (no more plain-text task IDs) by falling back to `DEFAULT_APP_URL` when `APP_URL` is unset; URL pattern updated to `/tasks/:id` to match the new-UI dashboard route. `buildProgressBlocks` now routes through `getTaskLink()` so progress headers also link out (#390, DES-283)

### Changed
- Default models updated in workflow executors (`raw-llm.ts`, `validate.ts`); regenerated `openapi.json` and `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/**`
- Jira `initJira()` / Linear `initLinear()` now overwrite stale `oauth_apps.redirectUri` values on boot (`upsertOAuthApp` heals existing rows when `JIRA_REDIRECT_URI` / `LINEAR_REDIRECT_URI` change, including the `MCP_BASE_URL`-preferred fallback)

## [1.72.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Claude Managed Agents harness provider** (`HARNESS_PROVIDER=claude-managed`). Sessions execute in Anthropic's managed cloud sandbox; the worker becomes a thin SSE relay that maps `client.beta.sessions.events.stream` events to the swarm's `ProviderEvent` union — no LLM process, no local CLI, no skill filesystem on the worker. New one-time `claude-managed-setup` CLI creates an Anthropic-side Environment, uploads `plugin/commands/*.md` skills via `client.beta.skills.create`, creates an Agent referencing those skills, and persists `MANAGED_AGENT_ID` + `MANAGED_ENVIRONMENT_ID` to `swarm_config` (encrypted). New env vars: `MANAGED_AGENT_ID`, `MANAGED_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `MANAGED_AGENT_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`), `MANAGED_GITHUB_VAULT_ID`, `MANAGED_GITHUB_TOKEN`. `MCP_BASE_URL` must be HTTPS-public (Anthropic's sandbox calls `/mcp` from the cloud) — adapter and entrypoint fail-fast otherwise. Cost computation accounts for token rates **plus** Anthropic's $0.08/session-hour runtime fee. New-UI Integrations dashboard surfaces the same config (Phase 7). Provider design rationale + SDK quirks documented in [`/docs/guides/harness-providers#claude-managed-agents`](/docs/guides/harness-providers) (#384)
- **Devin harness provider** (`HARNESS_PROVIDER=devin`). New env vars: `DEVIN_API_KEY` (cog_*), `DEVIN_ORG_ID` (org_*), `DEVIN_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (default 15s), `DEVIN_ACU_COST_USD` (default $2.25), `DEVIN_API_BASE_URL`, `DEVIN_MAX_ACU_LIMIT`. Standalone `.env.docker-devin.example` template added (#378)
- **Per-agent + global daily cost budgets** with refusal-at-claim. New tables `agent_budgets`, `swarm_budgets`, and `agent_pricing` (migrations 046 + 047). New routes `GET /api/budgets`, `PUT /api/budgets/{agentId}`, `GET /api/pricing` plus session-cost recompute on Codex sessions. Workers honor budgets in `poll-task` / `task-action` claim gates — refused claims emit a Slack notification via `budget-refusal-notify`. Backoff timing for refused-budget retries lives in `src/utils/budget-backoff.ts` (#385)
- **Budgets + spend dashboard at `/budgets`** in the new-UI (DES-278). New router page, sidebar entry, `useBudgets` hook, and `useIntegrationsMeta` API client wiring. Surfaces global + per-agent budgets, current spend, and refusal events (#386)
- New CLI command `claude-managed-setup` (run from your laptop) — bootstraps the Anthropic-side Agent + Environment and persists IDs to `swarm_config`. `--force` recreates from scratch
- New CLI command `codex-login` — interactive ChatGPT OAuth bootstrap for Codex workers (refactored out of the in-tree Codex setup)

### Changed
- `package.json` version bump to `1.72.0`; regenerated `openapi.json` and `docs-site/content/docs/api-reference/**`
- `runner.ts` claim path now consults the budget-admission gate before promoting `pending` → `in_progress`; refusal records a session-cost row with `cost_source = "refusal"`
- README "Multi-provider" line now lists Claude Code, Codex, pi-mono, **Devin**, and **Claude Managed Agents**

## [1.71.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- `initJira()` / `initLinear()` now prefer `MCP_BASE_URL` over the localhost default when `JIRA_REDIRECT_URI` / `LINEAR_REDIRECT_URI` are unset. The previous fallback was being persisted into `oauth_apps.redirectUri` and used verbatim by the OAuth authorize flow, so prod was sending users back to `http://localhost:3013/...` after Atlassian/Linear consent — even though the UI displayed the correct request-derived URL. Existing rows are healed automatically by `upsertOAuthApp` on next boot

## [1.71.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- `DELETE /api/trackers/jira/disconnect` and `DELETE /api/trackers/linear/disconnect` — Jira disconnect deletes registered webhooks, OAuth tokens, and metadata; Linear revokes upstream and drops tokens. Both endpoints surface in the Integrations UI as a "Disconnect" button next to the OAuth status
- `/status` responses for both Jira and Linear now include the computed `redirectUri` so the OAuth cards can render it with a copy button. The `JIRA_REDIRECT_URI` / `LINEAR_REDIRECT_URI` form fields were removed (env vars still work as overrides)

### Changed
- OAuth flow opens in a new tab via `window.open` so the dashboard context survives the round-trip; status auto-refreshes on focus
- Webhook/redirect base URL is now derived from the inbound request when `MCP_BASE_URL` is unset; boot warns when `MCP_BASE_URL == APP_URL` (the prod misconfig)

### Fixed
- Jira/Linear "not configured" alert chips no longer wrap mid-pill on narrow viewports (`whitespace-nowrap` + extracted `CodeChip` helper)
- shadcn `AlertDescription` rendered each `<code>` chip on its own grid row because of `display: grid; gap-1`. Wrapping inline content in a single `<p>` collapses children into one grid item so chips flow inline as intended

## [1.71.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Jira Cloud integration** — full OAuth 3LO authorization code flow against `api.atlassian.com`, cloudId resolution via `/oauth/token/accessible-resources`, and a typed `jiraFetch()` that prepends `/ex/jira/{cloudId}`, refreshes on 401, and respects 429 `Retry-After`. New routes: `GET /authorize`, `GET /callback`, `GET /status`, `POST /webhook/:token`, `POST /api/trackers/jira/webhook-register`, `DELETE /api/trackers/jira/webhook/:id`. Inbound: assignee→bot transitions and @-mention comments create swarm tasks; outbound: lifecycle events (`task.created/completed/failed/cancelled`) post unicode-emoji plaintext comments back to the originating issue. Webhook auth uses URL-path token (timing-safe compare) — Atlassian doesn't HMAC-sign OAuth 3LO dynamic webhooks (Errata I8). Webhook keepalive runs every 12h and refreshes any registration with <7d to expiry. New ADF (Atlassian Document Format) recursive walker for inbound comment/issue body parsing. Migration `043_jira_source.sql` adds `jira` to the `agent_tasks` source CHECK constraint. 57 new unit tests across `jira-metadata`, `jira-webhook`, `jira-sync`, `jira-oauth`, `jira-outbound-sync`, `jira-webhook-lifecycle`. Full integration guide at [`/docs/guides/jira-integration`](/docs/guides/jira-integration). New Integrations UI card with cloudId/siteUrl/scope/expiry/webhook count + copyable redirect URL (#382)
- New tracker provider `jira` is now recognized by `tracker-status`, `tracker-link-task`, `tracker-map-agent`, and `tracker-sync-status` MCP tools

### Fixed
- `botAccountId` cache moved to a `globalThis`-keyed slot so all module instances share the same value across cache-busting dynamic imports under `bun:test`'s parallel file runner. Fixes a CI-only test-isolation gap in `jira-sync.test.ts`
- Two test files using `mock.module` on real modules (`jira-oauth.test.ts` mocking `oauth/wrapper`, `jira-webhook.test.ts` mocking `jira/sync`) switched to `spyOn` against namespace imports — `mock.module` overrides leak across the test process and broke victim files when bun:test's parallel-file order put the mocking file first

## [1.70.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Uniform `contextKey` column on `agent_tasks` populated at every task-ingress site (Slack, AgentMail, GitHub, GitLab, Linear, scheduler, workflow, `send-task`). Schema: `task:slack:{channelId}:{threadTs}`, `task:agentmail:{threadId}`, `task:trackers:github:{owner}:{repo}:{issue|pr}:{number}`, `task:trackers:gitlab:{projectId}:{mr|issue}:{iid}`, `task:trackers:linear:{issueIdentifier}`, `task:schedule:{scheduleId}`, `task:workflow:{workflowRunId}`. Migration 041 adds nullable `contextKey` plus `(contextKey, status)` composite index. Child tasks auto-inherit from parent via `parentTaskId` (#358)
- Cross-ingress sibling-task awareness (phase 2): reader-side prompt injection surfaces sibling/parent tasks sharing the same `contextKey` so workers see related work across ingress paths. Includes additive `ADDITIVE_SLACK` buffer generalization and Linear hard-refuse UX fix (#359)
- New harness-providers guide at [`/docs/guides/harness-providers`](/docs/guides/harness-providers) covering the `ProviderAdapter` contract, task↔session lifecycle, raw session-log pipeline, swarm-MCP exposure, system-prompt composition/delivery, skills handling, and a 15-step walkthrough grounded in the claude / pi / codex reference adapters (`docs-site/content/docs/(documentation)/guides/harness-providers.mdx`)
- `slack-post` gains an optional `threadTs` parameter so the lead can post threaded replies under an existing message, and a sibling `slack-start-thread` tool posts a top-level message and returns `{ channelId, ts }` so subsequent `slack-post` calls can thread under it. Unblocks daily-digest flows where the parent is a summary and the body is an in-thread reply (#373)
- `GET /api/mcp-oauth/{id}/authorize-url` returns `{ providerUrl }` (Bearer-authed) so the dashboard Connect flow can XHR-then-navigate and keep Bearer auth on the authed endpoint while letting the browser follow the provider redirect directly (#372)

### Fixed
- `core.ts` HTTP middleware now honors per-route `auth: { apiKey: false }` via a `routeRegistry` lookup instead of a hardcoded exception list, so `/api/mcp-oauth/callback` and other opt-out routes no longer 401 on API_KEY swarms. Unknown paths still fail closed. Adds middleware unit tests (#367, #372)
- Docker entrypoint no longer inlines MCP credentials (OAuth Bearers, static headers, env-backed secrets) into `/workspace/.mcp.json` at boot; it now only uses installed-server names to seed `settings.json` permission patterns. The per-session merge in `claude-adapter.ts` is extracted into a pure `mergeMcpConfig` and flipped so installed servers from the API **override** on-disk entries, restoring the "resolve at dispatch time" guarantee from 1.69.0 so OAuth re-auth, secret rotation, and install/uninstall propagate without worker restart. 8 new unit tests cover precedence, uninstall propagation, and staleness (#369, #371)
- MCP OAuth `Authorization` header now normalizes `token_type: "bearer"` to capital `Bearer`, so providers like Amplitude's MCP (which reject the RFC 6749 lowercase form despite RFC 6750 being case-insensitive) accept the token. Non-bearer schemes pass through verbatim (#370)
- `update-profile` tool now gates `Bun.write("/workspace/SOUL.md" | "/workspace/IDENTITY.md")` on `requestInfo.agentId === process.env.AGENT_ID`, so test-suite fake `WORKER_ID`s no longer overwrite a real container's identity files. Also raises `IDENTITY_FILE_MIN_LENGTH` in `src/hooks/hook.ts` from 100 → 500 as defense-in-depth against the Stop hook syncing short sentinel writes back into the DB (#374)

## [1.69.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1` is now set by default for every Claude Code session spawned via `ClaudeAdapter`. Opt out via `swarm_config` or environment (`ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=0`). Regenerated `openapi.json` + API reference pages for the version bump

## [1.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **OAuth 2.0 MCP support for headless swarms** — end-to-end support for OAuth 2.0-protected MCP servers running inside worker containers. Workers resolve a valid access token at dispatch time (refreshing on expiry), inject it into the provider config, and propagate token-refresh failures back to the task without leaking tokens into logs or prompts (#357)
- `POST /api/mcp-oauth/{mcpServerId}/authorize` / `GET /api/mcp-oauth/callback` — browser-driven OAuth authorization code flow for user-scoped MCP servers (#357)
- `POST /api/mcp-oauth/{mcpServerId}/manual-client` — operator-supplied client credentials for MCP servers that don't implement dynamic client registration (#357)
- `GET /api/mcp-oauth/{mcpServerId}/metadata` / `GET /api/mcp-oauth/{mcpServerId}/status` — metadata discovery (RFC 8414) and per-server OAuth status for the Integrations UI (#357)
- `POST /api/mcp-oauth/{mcpServerId}/refresh` / `DELETE /api/mcp-oauth/{mcpServerId}` — manual refresh and revocation endpoints (#357)
- New MCP OAuth panel in the dashboard (`new-ui/src/pages/mcp-servers/[id]/mcp-oauth-panel.tsx`) for authorize / refresh / revoke / manual-client management, with live status from `use-mcp-oauth.ts` (#357)
- Encrypted-at-rest OAuth token storage via migration `041_mcp_oauth_tokens.sql`, reusing the `swarm_config` AES-256-GCM encryption key; access tokens are never returned over HTTP (#357)
- Dummy OAuth MCP server reference implementation at `scripts/dummy-oauth-mcp/` for local testing of the full flow (authorization code, PKCE, dynamic client registration, refresh) (#357)
- 1100+ lines of new test coverage across `src/tests/mcp-oauth-*.test.ts` (queries, resolve-secrets, ensure-token, wrapper) (#357)

## [1.68.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- New `/integrations` dashboard page that lets operators configure third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Sentry, AgentMail, Anthropic, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Codex, business-use) without hand-editing `.env`. Frontend-only catalog in `new-ui/src/lib/integrations-catalog.ts`, one form field per known `swarm_config` key, with labels, help text, docs links, and category/search filters (#364)
- `POST /api/config/reload` — thin wrapper over the existing `/internal/reload-config` so the Integrations UI can apply saved values live (re-inits AgentMail, GitHub, Linear, stops/starts Slack socket mode) without a process restart (#364)
- `GET /api/config/env-presence?keys=K1,K2,...` — returns `{ presence: { KEY: boolean } }` so the UI can surface which values come from the deployment env vs the DB without ever pushing raw env values to the browser (#364)
- Per-field **Replace** / **Clear** affordances on the Integrations detail page. Secrets render masked (`••••••`); non-secret values (emails, channel names, flags) edit in place. Save auto-invokes reload and toasts which integrations were re-initialized (#364)
- Source chips on each field: `db+env` (live), `env (deploy)` (no DB row), `db (pending reload)` — rendered via shadcn Tooltip for fast hover reveal. Collapsible legend on the list page explains every chip (#364)

### Changed
- Sidebar restructured: Chat and Services hidden (routes still accessible); new **AI** group (Skills, MCP Servers); new **Configuration** group (Integrations, Templates, Approvals, Repos). Breadcrumbs now resolve integration ids to display names (`github` → "GitHub") and include proper-case labels for Integrations and API Keys (#364)
- Toaster references the correct Tailwind v4 CSS vars (`--color-popover` instead of `--popover`) and pins `!bg-popover` so toasts are opaque instead of translucent (#364)

## [1.67.5] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Centralized secret scrubber (`src/utils/secret-scrubber.ts`) that replaces sensitive env values and known-shape tokens (GitHub PATs, Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter `sk-*` keys, Slack `xox*`, JWTs, AWS access keys, Google API keys) with `[REDACTED:<name>]` markers at every text-egress point — adapter log files, `session_logs` writes, pretty-printed stdout, stderr dumps — so credentials never leak into `/workspace/logs/*.jsonl`, the `session_logs` SQLite table, or container stdout shipped to log aggregators (#363)
- `CLAUDE.md` contributor note directing future code that logs/prints/transports sensitive values to wrap emitted strings with `scrubSecrets()` at the egress point (#363)

## [1.67.4] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Slack thread follow-ups that `@`-mention a different user/bot (e.g. `@Devin wdyt?`) no longer create spurious tasks for the swarm agent. Both the router thread-follow-up branch (`src/slack/router.ts`) and the `ADDITIVE_SLACK` buffer branch (`src/slack/handlers.ts`) now use a new `hasOtherUserMention()` helper and bail when the message mentions another `<@U...>` and does not mention our bot (#355)

## [1.67.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000` on every SQLite connection (`src/be/db.ts`, applied on both fresh-DB and `Database.deserialize` paths) so concurrent writer contention (heartbeat sweep vs. `/ping`, `/close`, agent registration) waits out the lock instead of failing instantly with `SQLITE_BUSY` (#354)
- Process-level `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection` log-and-continue handlers in `src/http/index.ts` as defense-in-depth against a single bad request taking the API pod down (#354)
- Composite index on `agent_tasks(slackChannelId, slackThreadTs, status)` (migration 040) to speed up Slack thread lookups used by the follow-up re-delegation guard (#345)
- Hero wireframe video back in `README.md` plus reproducible Remotion source in `assets/video-source/` (two compositions: daily-evolution and slack-to-pr) (#350)

### Changed
- Removed hardcoded seed users from migration 031; added `scripts/backfill-seed-users.sql` for manual re-seeding (#343)
- Lead agent session template now references `manage-user` tool for registering unknown users from Slack (#343)
- Lead session prompt and `task.worker.completed` / `task.worker.failed` templates updated to explicitly forbid re-delegating follow-up results back to a worker (#345)

### Fixed
- API server no longer crashes with an unhandled `SQLiteError: database is locked` when heartbeat and HTTP writers race on the `agents` row — `busy_timeout` plus process-level guards together stop a single lock collision from failing every in-flight request (#354)
- Duplicate Slack responses caused by the lead re-delegating follow-up tasks: `send-task` now blocks re-delegation when the thread already has a completed task within the last 48 hours, and the follow-up template discourages it at the prompt layer (#345)

## [1.67.2] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `sqlite-vec` native extension bundled in Docker server image for vector similarity search; new `SQLITE_VEC_EXTENSION_PATH` env var points at the extension inside the container

### Changed
- Bumped bundled Claude Code CLI version in `Dockerfile.worker` from 2.1.109 to 2.1.112

## [1.67.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` / on-disk `.encryption-key` now also accept a 64-character hex-encoded 32-byte key (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) in addition to the existing base64 format. Existing base64 keys keep working unchanged.
- Invalid-key errors now include the exact generation commands (`openssl rand -base64 32` or `openssl rand -hex 32`) and call out the common `openssl rand -base64 39` mistake, instead of just reporting the byte count.

### Docs
- New **Encryption Key** section in the Docker Compose deployment guide covering resolution order, generation, backup, common mistakes, and first-time migration from plaintext
- `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` added to the Environment Variables reference

## [1.67.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Encrypted-at-rest storage for `swarm_config` `isSecret=1` rows using AES-256-GCM
- New `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` env vars for providing the master key (otherwise auto-generated at `<data-dir>/.encryption-key` only when the DB does not yet contain encrypted secret rows — e.g. a fresh DB or first upgrade from plaintext-only secrets)
- Auto-migration of legacy plaintext secrets to ciphertext on first boot after upgrade

### Security
- `swarm_config` API now rejects reserved keys `API_KEY` and `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (case-insensitive) at the HTTP, MCP, and DB layers — these remain environment-only and can no longer be stored in the SQLite config store
- Secrets are no longer stored as plaintext in `agent-swarm-db.sqlite`; on-disk rows carry only base64-encoded AES-256-GCM payloads of `iv || ciphertext || authTag`

### Operator notes
- Upgrade is transparent as long as the same encryption key remains available across restarts; legacy plaintext secrets are auto-migrated on first boot after upgrade
- Existing databases that already contain encrypted secret rows now fail closed if the encryption key is missing, instead of silently auto-generating a different key
- **First-time migration safety:** If upgrading from plaintext without `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set, a one-time plaintext backup is created at `<db-path>.backup.secrets-YYYY-MM-DD.env` before encryption. **Delete this file after verifying your encryption key is backed up.**
- **Back up and preserve the actual encryption key material alongside your SQLite DB** — whether it comes from `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`, or an auto-generated `.encryption-key`. Losing that key means losing all encrypted secrets with no recovery path
- Do not switch between env/file/auto-generated key sources unless the underlying base64 key value is identical
- Key rotation is not yet supported (follow-up release)

## [1.66.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `swarmVersion` column on `agent_tasks` — each task is stamped with the current package.json version at creation time, enabling benchmarking agent performance (cost, duration, tokens) across releases (#332)
- Task detail page shows "Swarm version" metadata row in the dashboard (#332)

### Changed
- Version bump 1.65.0 → 1.66.0 to mark the benchmarking tracking boundary (#332)

## [1.65.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Memory TTL support — memories can now have an `expiresAt` field; expired memories are automatically excluded from search results (#327)
- Memory staleness management with access tracking — `accessCount` field tracks how often a memory is retrieved, enabling recency-aware reranking (#327)
- `memory-delete` MCP tool for explicit memory removal (#327)
- Memory provider abstraction layer (`EmbeddingProvider`, `MemoryStore` interfaces) for pluggable storage and embedding backends (#327)
- Memory reranker combining vector similarity, recency decay, and access frequency into a unified relevance score (#327)

### Changed
- Memory system refactored from monolithic `db.ts` functions into modular `src/be/memory/` provider architecture with SQLite+sqlite-vec store and OpenAI embedding provider (#327)
- `memory-search` now uses the reranker pipeline for improved result quality (#327)
- `inject-learning` and `store-progress` updated to support new memory metadata fields (#327)

## [1.64.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Anonymized telemetry integration — tracks high-level task lifecycle events (created, started, completed, failed, cancelled), server start, and worker session start/end. Opt-out via `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false` (#325)

### Fixed
- Rate limit detection now matches "hit your limit" error messages in addition to existing patterns (#324)
- Workflow `mustPass` validation failures now cancel only the failed branch's downstream nodes instead of the entire workflow run; parallel/sibling branches continue executing (#322)
- Published package now includes `tsconfig.json`

## [1.64.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Release cut after merging the latest `main`, carrying forward the Codex ChatGPT OAuth support, provider-auth documentation, and telemetry updates already landed on this branch.

## [1.63.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- `agent-swarm codex-login` now supports an interactive ChatGPT OAuth flow for Codex workers: it prompts for the target swarm API URL, uses best-effort masked API key input, stores credentials as the global `codex_oauth` config entry, and documents the laptop-to-Docker-Compose restore flow for deployed swarms.

### Fixed
- Codex Docker workers now convert stored `codex_oauth` credentials into the real `~/.codex/auth.json` format expected by the Codex CLI, so ChatGPT OAuth works after container boot without `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Codex tasks authenticated through ChatGPT OAuth now stamp `credentialKeyType=CODEX_OAUTH`, so the API Keys dashboard and cost tracking surfaces show OAuth-backed Codex usage alongside other credential types.

## [1.63.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Codex provider** — Run agents with OpenAI Codex via `HARNESS_PROVIDER=codex`. Wraps `@openai/codex-sdk` 0.118 to drive the `codex app-server` JSON-RPC protocol. Includes per-session MCP config (Streamable HTTP), slash-command skill inlining, AGENTS.md system-prompt injection, AbortController-based cancellation, tool-loop detection, heartbeat/activity reporting, and a typed model catalogue (gpt-5.4 default). Auth via `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `~/.codex/auth.json` (#100)
- Docker worker image installs the Codex CLI (`@openai/codex@0.118.0`) alongside Claude and pi-mono and ships a baseline `~/.codex/config.toml`; entrypoint validates codex auth, bootstraps `~/.codex/auth.json` from `OPENAI_API_KEY` via `codex login --with-api-key` at boot (idempotent), and mirrors slash-command skills into `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (#100)
- Per-model pricing table for Codex models in `src/providers/codex-models.ts` (gpt-5.4, gpt-5.4-mini, gpt-5.3-codex, gpt-5.2-codex) sourced from developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing — codex tasks now record real `totalCostUsd` in `session_costs` and contribute to dashboard cost summaries (#100)
- `name` and `provider` columns on the `api_key_status` table — pooled credentials now carry an auto-derived harness provider (claude/pi/codex) and an optional human-friendly label settable from the dashboard. New `PATCH /api/keys/name` endpoint and the API Keys page in the dashboard gains a Name column (click to rename via Dialog) and a Provider dropdown filter (#100)
- Provider-aware credential pooling — `resolveCredentialPools` accepts a `provider` hint and only pools env vars relevant to the active harness, so a codex worker no longer stamps a stale `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` on its task records (#100)
- Codex `[context-overflow]` failure rewrite — when a codex turn hits the context window, the failure message is rewritten with a clear prefix and points users at Linear DES-143 for the auto-compaction follow-up. Codex `reasoning`, `todo_list`, and `agent_message` deltas now flow as `custom` ProviderEvents (`codex.reasoning`, `codex.todo_list`, `codex.message_delta`) so future UI surfaces can render them without raw_log scraping (#100)
- `scripts/e2e-docker-provider.ts` now supports `--provider codex` and `--provider all` (claude+pi+codex) for end-to-end Docker testing (#100)
- Codex log support in the dashboard's session log viewer — `parseSessionLogs` dispatches on `cli === "codex"` and maps Codex's `item.completed` events (`agent_message`, `mcp_tool_call`, `command_execution`, `reasoning`, `file_change`, `web_search`, `todo_list`) to the same ContentBlock schema used by claude/pi (#100)
- Slack message deduplication with `slackReplySent` flag — when agents post results via `slack-reply`, the task completion message shows a minimal one-liner instead of duplicating the full output (#314)
- Tree-based Slack status messages — parent tasks render child task progress in a visual tree with status icons, indentation, and overflow handling (#314)
- Slack thread buffer (`ADDITIVE_SLACK=true`) — non-mention thread replies are captured, debounced, and batched into a single follow-up task with dependency chaining (#314)
- `!now` command in Slack threads to flush the additive buffer immediately without dependency chaining (#314)
- `SLACK_THREAD_FOLLOWUP_REQUIRE_MENTION` env var — when `true`, thread follow-up routing and additive buffering require an explicit @mention (#313)
- `slackChannelId`, `slackThreadTs`, `slackUserId` parameters on `send-task` MCP tool for explicit Slack context propagation (#314)
- GitHub eyes reaction (👀) automatically added when agents pick up GitHub-sourced tasks — supports issue comments, PR review comments, PR reviews, and issue/PR bodies (#310)
- Discoverability Optimizer agent template added to `docker-compose.example.yml` (#311)

### Fixed
- Codex adapter `peakContextPercent` no longer clamps to 100% on chatty turns — the SDK reports `input_tokens` as per-turn-cumulative across every model invocation (with cached portions counted at every roundtrip), which routinely exceeds the model's context window even when no individual call did. New formula uses `(input - cached + output) / window` as a peak proxy (#100)
- Codex adapter `contextPercent` is now emitted on the same 0-100 scale as claude/pi (was 0-1 fraction), so the dashboard's `Peak %` cell renders correctly via `.toFixed(0)` (#100)
- Dashboard `model` badge falls back to `costs[0]?.model` when `task.model` is null — codex tasks created without an explicit model in the POST body now display the actual model used (recorded by the runner in `session_costs`) (#100)
- DataGrid wrapper auto-detects editable columns and only suppresses cell focus when none are present — read-only tables are unaffected, editable columns can now take focus (#100)
- Codex SDK binary path resolved via `CODEX_PATH_OVERRIDE` env var (`/usr/bin/codex` in the Docker image) — the bundled SDK can no longer `require.resolve("@openai/codex")` from inside a Bun-compiled executable, so the override sidesteps the failure (#100)

### Changed
- Slack completion messages now conditionally show minimal or full output based on whether the agent already posted via `slack-reply` (#314)
- Buffer flush messages show dependency status ("queued pending completion" vs "batched into task") (#314)

## [1.59.3] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Slack assistant thread: `file_share` messages now correctly route to the lead agent instead of being silently dropped (DES-138, #304)
- Slack assistant `setStatus`/`setTitle` calls wrapped with error handling to prevent crashes in non-assistant threads

### Changed
- `registerRegisterAgentMailInboxTool` renamed to `registerRegisterAgentmailInboxTool` for naming consistency
